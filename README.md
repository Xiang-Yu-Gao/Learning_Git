## Learning how to use git
I create my first GitHub Repository on June 2nd. 2024.
I install GitHub Desktop on My Win Desktop on June 2nd. 2024.
I connect local and remote repository by using GitHub URL:https://github.com/Xiang-Yu-Gao/Learning_Git
I make a change on GitHub and test whether I can see the change in RStudio.
